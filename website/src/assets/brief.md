J.R. Photography website brief

Outcomes:
A fully functioning website that showcases my work. Slick and professional. I’d like it if the website had a sense of story and focused in on certain projects I can let you know which ones when your ready. 

Sites for inspiration:
https://www.withlove.studio/

Specifics:
Needs to have sections for: projects, work, contact, about. 
Linked to my social media – LinkedIn and Instagram.
